# Lab 1
# Task 1: Choosing an Open Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Student Performance dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is tabular and available in CSV format, making it suitable for machine learning tasks such as prediction and pattern discovery. It contains demographic, social, and academic information about secondary school students.

# Task 2: Defining the Machine Learning Problem
This machine learning problem is a regression task that aims to predict a student’s final grade (G3) using demographic, social, and academic features such as study time, past failures, family background, and school support. The dataset contains tabular data collected from secondary school students, and the target variable is the final grade achieved at the end of the course. By learning patterns from the input features, the model is expected to estimate students’ academic performance and identify factors that influence educational outcomes.
